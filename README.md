   # README-Generator

   ## Description
   
   The application allows a user to quickly generate a repo by inputting readme section. I made this application so that users can quicly create a readme.md file . This  application  reduces the time  a developer takes away from coding.  While creating this app I learned that inquirer allows user input through the command line and we can store the inputed valued into template literal.
